                <h3>Why is the Holy Spirit Important</h3>
<h4>A necessity for the Kingdom of God</h4>
<p>Early in Jesus’s ministry, a Pharisee approached him and inquired about the great signs Jesus was performing. In response, Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God(John 3:5). </p>
<p>Connecting the dots between different passages in the bible can be tricky; however, I implore you to read all of 2 Corinthians 5(Emphasising vv. 17-18) and Ephesians 2(Emphasising vv. 6). While the audiences differ in the passages, a common theme of dying to self and being made alive in Christ is present throughout these scriptures and many others.</p>
<p>Until we understand and practice submitting our conveniences, ideas, and even our needs to God, we cannot and will not be disciples of Jesus(Luke 9:23). And through the combination of faith and action(James 2:14-26) of Jesus’s teaching, the Holy Spirit will be made available to his followers. Finally, through this gift of the Holy Spirit, we will have the hope of an eternity with God(John 2:14-15).</p>
<h4>He helps us to be more like Jesus</h4>
<p>We are imperfect beings. In Jesus’s infinite wisdom, he gifted us an advocate/counselor to strengthen, teach, and encourage us during our walk on earth. </p>
<p>Just before Jesus’s time on earth was ending, he provided hope to his disciples through the promise of the Holy Spirit on the condition of showing love to Jesus through the following of his commands.</p>
<div align="center"> <em>“If you love me, keep my commands. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever-- The Spirit of truth” - John 14:15-16(NIV)</em></div>

<p>The Holy Spirit working through the lives of Jesus’s disciples was never supposed to be mysterious, confusing, and divisive. These three passages paint a clear picture of what it looks like when filled with the Holy Spirit.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.” - 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.” - Galatians 5:22-25</em></p>
</li>
<li><em>“Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.” - Colossians 3:12-15</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Edification of the church</h4>
<p>We rob our brothers, sisters, friends, colleagues, and God when we don’t understand how God’s grace in the form of the Holy Spirit is supposed to benefit the church.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit displays its power, blessings, and teaching differently in each person (1 Corinthians 12:11). This difference isn’t designed to puff egos, humble the proud, or make anyone feel inferior. Its purpose is to aid the body of believers in interdependence (1 Corinthians 12: 12-26)! The different ways the Holy Spirit manifests is a feature, not a flaw.  </p>
<p>The Holy Spirit’s manifestation and relationship is unique in each disciple. Maturing christians grow in their concern about how the entire body of Christ is functioning – not only what particular spiritual gift they may possess. Paul writes about this maturity in Romans 12: 3-6:</p>
<div align="center"> <em>“For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.” - Romans 12:3-6 NIV </em></div>

<p>When we view the Holy Spirit as a helper, not deserved by our actions, God can better use His people to edify His church.</p>
<h3>Words of Caution</h3>
<h4>Leave room for God</h4>
<p>God isn’t the bible, and the bible isn’t God. Your Pastor isn’t God. Your family isn’t God. And you aren’t God. God is God, and He wants to love and be in a relationship with each of his children(1 John 4: 9-10). Human ideas and actions fail to capture the excellence and divinity of God. Jesus acknowledged the accuracy of the teaching of the pharisees in Matthew 22, but condemned their character. There was no room for Jesus in the Pharisees’ pomposity. </p>
<h4>God’s spirit simply can’t be studied</h4>
<p>No article, sermon, or conversation can convey the entirety of the Holy Spirit. Part of learning about the Holy Spirit is experiencing God's presence. The next section details some spiritual disciplines we can use to begin or deepen our relationships with God throughout our lives.</p>
<h3>Spiritual Disciplines</h3>
<p>God gifts us many tools to connect with Him, so he may fill us up to bring Him glory. While there always needs to be a healthy dose of study and prayer, there are many ways we can connect with God-given our season in life and/or circumstances. </p>
<p>There is a great podcast episode from The BEMA Podcast about creating space for God to work in our lives. Below is a summary of some disciplines commonly practiced. Feel free to experiment and be creative; the disciplines themselves are not scripturally mandated. The goal is to connect with God, so He can bring about His glory through you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bible Study<ul>
<li>“Character” Study - While the people in the bible are characters in a fictional novel; however, focusing on a specific person or persons can offer much insight </li>
<li>Chapter Study - Really engaging with and understanding segments of the bible</li>
<li>Theme Study -Studying specific themes of the bible such a love, patience, or prayer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prayer<ul>
<li>Prayer Journaling - Logging our prayer over a period of time routinely</li>
<li>Fixed-Hour Prayer/ Daily Offices - Stop whatever you are doing and say a quick prayer to God at a consistent time of day</li>
<li>Contemplative Prayer - A prayer that is slow, thoughtful, and repetitious with the purpose of hearing God’s voice</li>
<li>Praying the Text - Praying with the words from scripture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presence <ul>
<li>Solitude/Sabbath/Silence - “Creating space to become more aware of the love, grace and companionship of God than the companionship, Demands and duties of life and others” - Marty Solomon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lifestyle<ul>
<li>Generosity </li>
<li>Gratitude - Intentionally giving thanks</li>
<li>Bible Meditation/Memorization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fasting/Self-Denial - A discipline that gets ourselves out of the way, by reminding us of our humanity, for God to work</li>
<li>Feasting &amp; Celebration - Part of life is enjoying the things that God has gifted us </li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="">Source: Bema Podcast: <a href="https://www.bemadiscipleship.com/24">Creating a Space</a></span></em></p>
<p>Continue studying the scripture, praying, reflecting, and loving until the day we attain unity in faith and knowledge measuring up to the stature of Jesus Christ.</p>
